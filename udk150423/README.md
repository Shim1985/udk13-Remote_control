433.92MHz RC power sockets

can control standard 220v power sockets remotely (â‰ˆ 30m distance).  easy and cheap to use but note: they react SLOW!

also check maximum watt. different rc sockets can take different loads. the two different models i have have a rating of 10A and 3600W maximum. double check manual before connecting heavy motors like vacuum cleaners (sidenote: since autumn 2014 there's a law in the EU that one can only buy less that 1600W vacuum cleaners - but old models might require more).

two different models...

![bauhaus](bauhaus.jpg?raw=true "bauhaus")

![reichelt](reichelt.jpg?raw=true "reichelt")

download and install the rc-switch library (v.2.52) for arduino <https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/>

then connect a receiver module like this...

![receiver](rc-switch_receiver.jpg.jpg?raw=true "receiver")

after that, upload the ReceiveDemo_Advanced sketch from rc-switch examples folder,
open serial monitor in arduino and set the baudrate to 9600.

then put in a battery in the rc remote and press some buttons. you should see something like this...

```cpp
//before running this connect the receiver and use ReceiveDemo_Advanced
//from rc-switch http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/ to get the numbers

//for the below code connect arduino pin 10, 5v and gnd to transmitter.

#include <RCSwitch.h>

#define ON 266516  //numbers you received with ReceiveDemo_Simple - edit to match
#define OFF 266517

RCSwitch mySwitch = RCSwitch();

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    mySwitch.enableTransmit(10);  //arduino pin
    mySwitch.setPulseLength(183); //pulselength - edit to match
    mySwitch.setProtocol(1);      //1 or 2 - edit to match

    mySwitch.send(OFF, 24);      //24 is length - edit to match
}
void loop() {
    delay(2000);
    mySwitch.send(ON, 24);
    delay(2000);
    mySwitch.send(OFF, 24);
}
```
